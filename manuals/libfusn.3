libfusn allows to be compiled with wide character support.
To compile libfusn with wide character support use
.Ar ./configure --enable-wide-character-type=yes
or pass the definition
.Ar HAVE_WIDE_CHARACTER_TYPE
 to the compiler (i.e. in case of Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVS) C++).

To have other code to determine if libfusn was compiled with wide character support it defines
.Ar LIBFUSN_WIDE_CHARACTER_TYPE
 in libfusn/features.h.
